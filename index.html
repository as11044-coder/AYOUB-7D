<h3>in the dusty, vibrant streets of Praia Grande, Brazil, a skinny kid named Neymar Jr. was rarely seen without a ball at his feet.
    Growing up in a household where electricity was sometimes a luxury, his father—a former pro footballer—guided him, teaching him to use his speed and flair to dance around defenders rather than run through them.
    In 2013, the "Prince of Brazil" moved to Europe, joining Barcelona.
    There, he joined forces with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, forming the "MSN" trio.
    The highlight came in 2017—the "La Remontada" against PSG—where Neymar, in a moment of pure genius, scored twice and assisted the winner in a historic 6-1 comeback, proving he could shine on the biggest stage.
Seeking to define his own legacy, he moved to PSG in 2017 for a world-record fee, becoming the most expensive player in history.
    
    Though his time in Paris was marked by brilliant goals, Ligue 1 titles, and frustrating injuries, he continued to carry the weight of a nation.
